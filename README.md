# Skool
## Introduction 
> Skool is an open source guide built upon, react, typescript, react-bootstrap, mobx, and firebase. It contains custom built react components that are common to the edu space

## Getting Started
> This repository is meant to be a guide for developing a good firebase structure and allow edu developers to extract certain aspects and components, to then be added to their projects.  We have extracted a lot of the custom user interface designs. To use this as a full starter implement your base site into the public folder and connect it to the react project using a div with the id of "root" in the index.html file.
